## Datasets:
[Leadblood levels]:
This dataset presents information on lead blood levels in Michigan for the year 2017, organized by the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Elevated blood lead levels (EBLL) are defined as exceeding 4.5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (Î¼g/dL). The data, sourced from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, was aggregated and anonymized by Data Driven Detroit. Null values in certain areas indicate a lack of blood lead level testing or suppressed numbers (fewer than 6) to safeguard individual privacy.
[Peds ED visits data]"
This dataset, managed by the Record Research Request Service (R3) at the University of Pittsburgh, focuses on UPMC clinical data for pediatric populations (ages 0-17) in Allegheny County. It covers emergency department (ED) categorized by Census Block Group geography using 2010 U.S. Census data. The ED data includes total visits, specific to asthma, injury, low-acuity, and respiratory tract infections. Low-acuity visits refer to less-serious or less-urgent cases discharged to normal residence. Primary care visit data includes total visits, well-child visits, and asthma diagnoses. It also includes estimated block group populations from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015-19 American Community Survey.
